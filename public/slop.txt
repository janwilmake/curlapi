# CURL Executor API

This API lets you run CURL commands through a REST interface.

## Basic Usage

Send a GET request to:
`YOUR_SERVER_URL/{encodedCurlCommand}`

Where `{encodedCurlCommand}` is your CURL command URL-encoded.

Example: `YOUR_SERVER_URL/curl%20https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com`

## Response Format

If successful (200):
- `status`: HTTP status code from your request
- `statusText`: Status text (like "OK")
- `headers`: All response headers
- `body`: Response body (text or JSON)

## Error Responses

- 400: Bad request - Invalid CURL command or too long
- 403: Forbidden - URL not allowed for security reasons
- 405: Method not allowed - Only GET requests supported
- 500: Server error during execution

## Limitations

- Only GET requests to the API are supported (though your CURL command can use any HTTP method)
- Certain URLs may be blocked for security
